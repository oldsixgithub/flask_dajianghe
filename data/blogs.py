                "type": "text",
                "value": "Another concern for new brands is inventory risk. Starting with a smaller quantity allows sellers to test product positioning, pricing, and customer feedback before scaling production. If adjustments are needed, packaging design, logo placement, or marketing positioning can be changed without large losses."

                "type": "text",
                "value": "Another frequent issue is not confirming logo placement. The charging coil location inside a wireless charger limits where a logo can be printed. Placing a logo directly above the coil center may affect appearance alignment or require repositioning during production. Confirming the logo position on a sample photo before mass production helps avoid misunderstandings."

                "value": "Packaging details are another area where mistakes occur. Some customers design retail packaging without checking the product dimensions, cable space, or accessory placement. This can lead to packaging that does not fit the product or requires redesign after printing, increasing both cost and lead time."
